# HEOR Concepts: A Zero-to-Hero Guide

## 1. The "Gym Membership" Analogy
Imagine a health insurance plan is like a company paying for its employees to go to the gym.

*   **Gross Cost**: The upfront price of the gym membership ($50/month * 100 employees).
*   **Adherence**: How many employees actually go? If only 45% go, the "real-world" utilized value is different (though for gym memberships you pay anyway; for drugs, plans often pay per claim).
*   **Medical Offsets (Savings)**: The "ROI". If the employees who go to the gym stop having heart attacks, the company saves money on hospital bills.
*   **Net Budget Impact**: (Cost of Memberships) minus (Savings from fewer heart attacks).

## 2. Key Terminology

### PMPM (Per Member Per Month)
The "Holy Grail" metric for insurance plans.
*   **Definition**: The total cost divided by the total number of members in the plan, divided by 12.
*   **Why it matters**: It tells the insurer exactly how much they need to raise premiums to cover a new drug.
*   **Formula**: `Net Budget Impact / Total Lives / 12`

### BIA (Budget Impact Analysis)
A financial forecast (usually 3-5 years) estimating the affordability of a new drug. Unlike *Cost-Effectiveness Analysis* (which looks at "Value for Money" or QALYs), BIA only cares about the **Checking Account**: "Can we afford this this year?"

### Sensitivity Analysis
Testing "What If" scenarios.
*   "What if the drug price is 10% higher?"
*   "What if uptake is double what we expect?"
*   Our Dashboard allows real-time Sensitivity Analysis via the sidebar sliders.

### ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)
*(Not used in this specific Budget Model, but good to know)*
The cost needed to gain ONE year of "perfect health" (1 QALY). In Canada, if a drug costs >$50,000 per QALY, it is often considered too expensive.

## 3. Canadian Context (CIHI 2024)
*   **Heart Attack Cost**: ~$25,000 CAD (variable by province).
*   **GLP-1s**: A class of drugs (e.g., Semaglutide) originally for Diabetes, now for Obesity.
*   **Rebates**: The "Sticker Price" vs. "Real Price". Payers almost never pay list price.
